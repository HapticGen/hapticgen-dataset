No, I never heard them at all, 'til there was you. There were birds in the sky, but I never saw them winging. No, I never saw them at all, 'til there was you. And there was music, and there were wonderful roses, they tell me, in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and dew. There was love, all around, but I never heard it singing. No, I never heard it at all, 'til there was you. There was love, all around, but I never heard it singing. No, I never heard it at all, 'til there was you.\"", "model": "HapticGen-Initial", "vote": 1}
